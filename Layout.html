      <h2> Planning your Layout </h2>
      <p> Before you type out the layout, it would be wise to draw or take a sample of a webpage that you like. Then take that page and divide it into sections. This would be the amount of "divs" you most likely would have to use on a page. A "div" is short for "division". It allows you to divide your page into containers or sections. 
      
     The more "divs" the webpage contains, the more complex the CSS styling will be for the webpage. To start out, I would stick with simple layouts.</p> 
      
     <p>Think of how you will divide up your content. Above, you can see samples of how a page can be divided up. Think about where the title of your page would go and the navigation tool bar. Where will the content go? Will you have a side bar?</p>
     <p>If you have trouble envisioning your site, take another website that you like and view the code for the page. I like to use Google's Chrome browser (Click <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/"> here </a> to download) because you can click on each section of the webpage or the code and see where the code is attached to on the page. 
     Right click and select <strong>"Inspect"</strong> to see the code. Copying the code won't allow your page to look and function exactly like the website.  Locate the "divs" and count the number the page uses to get an idea for your webpage. 
     
    <p> For my website, I used the following layout.
    <br>
    <br>
<center>    <img class= "middle" src="Images/layout.jpg"> </center>
    
    <p>The code for the site is as follows</p>
<center>    <img class="middle" src="Images/divs.jpg"> </center>
    
   <p> We give each div a <strong> div class = "name"</strong> in order to style each section 
   in CSS when the time comes. You can have multiple names in the same div class so it will be easier
   to group them in CSS for stying many elements at once. </p>
   <p>I have a <strong> div id="name"</strong> because I want to single this element specifically and apply a 
   style only to this element. I may also want to use JavaScript in the future to manipulate that item. Therefore IDs should only be used
   once as not to create a coding conflict in the future with Javascript.</p> 
   <p> Next think of how you will arrange your content. Make sure there is uniformity in the content of your page. This will help when it comes around to styling your page using CSS (Casading Style Sheet). For this website, I divided up the webpage as follows
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Header</strong> </li>
              <ul>
                  <li>Title</li>
                  <li>Subtitle</li>
                  </ul>
            <li><strong>Navigation</strong> (your webpages)</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>index.html</li>
                  <li>skeleton.html</li>
                  <li>layout.html</li>
                  <li>content.html</li>
                  <li>styling.html</li>
                  <li>resources.html</li>
              </ul>
            <li><strong>Body</strong></li>
               <ul>
                   <li>Image</li>
                   <li> Title of my article</li>
                   <li> Text of article</li>
                   <li> more images</li>
                   <li> more text</li>
                   <li> links</li>
                   <li> image link to next page</li>
               </ul>
           <li><strong> Footer</strong></li>
               <ul>
                   <li> copyright section</li>
               </ul>
        </ul>
        
            
  <p> Now that you have an idea of how your page will look like, let's get to the juicy part of your website--the <a href="Content.html">Content</a>. Bon appetit!</p>
